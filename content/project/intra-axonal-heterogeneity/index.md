Investigating the impact of myelination variations along a single axon on action potential (AP) conduction.  

### Summary
  
#### **Background**
  - Myelination is crucial for rapid and efficient nerve signal propagation.
  - Traditional models assume uniform myelination, but recent findings suggest significant variability along axons.

#### **Materials and Methods**
  - We used a double-cable computational model.
  - We analysed variations in internode length, myelin thickness, and periaxonal space width.
  - We conducted simulations in MATLAB to observe effects on AP conduction velocity and amplitude.

#### **Results**
  - Individual variations in internode length, myelin thickness, and periaxonal space width alone do not significantly impact AP properties.
  - Combined variations of these parameters significantly reduce conduction velocity and peak amplitude.

#### **Conclusion**
  - Incorporating intra-axonal heterogeneity into computational models is essential for accurately representing neuronal signal conduction.
  - These findings have implications for understanding both normal neuronal function and demyelinating disorders.
