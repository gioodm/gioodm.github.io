Variation in myelination along a single axon significantly reduces the peak amplitude and conduction.

### Results summary:

Variations in myelination along a single axon significantly reduce peak amplitude and conduction velocity. These differences are mainly explained by small differences in mean myelination level, not by the distinct distribution of myelination along the axon.
Intra-axonal Variation:
Variations in internode length, myelin thickness, and periaxonal space width were analyzed. Each parameter was varied separately and in combination.
It was found that varying all three parameters together significantly reduced the action potential (AP) conduction velocity and amplitude​(PRO4003_final_report)​.
Data Analysis:
Mean and standard deviation of voltage peak values and conduction velocity were calculated.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the main sources of variation in AP conduction.
Effect on AP Velocity and Amplitude:
Intra-axonal variation in periaxonal space width, myelin thickness, and internode length alone did not significantly change conduction velocity or mean voltage peak value. However, varying all parameters together significantly reduced both conduction velocity and mean voltage peak value​(PRO4003_final_report)​.
Conclusion:
Structural variation of myelin sheaths impacts neuronal properties, specifically reducing AP amplitude and conduction velocity.
The updated double-cable model provides a more biologically accurate framework for studying the effects of myelin distribution irregularity, with implications for understanding both healthy and diseased conditions​(PRO4003_final_report)​.
