abstract: WASP, <ins>W</ins>hole-proteome <ins>A</ins>nnotation through <ins>S</ins>tructural-homology <ins>P</ins>ipeline, is a python-based software leveraging structural homology to enhance protein annotation at scale, providing a more comprehensive understanding of protein functions across various organisms. WASP relies on network topology for better accuracy and more robust statistical power. WASP highlights the importance of structural homology in systematically identifying novel annotations which were previously missed by sequence-based tools.
