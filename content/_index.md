        My research lies at the intersection of bioengineering, structural biology, and machine learning. My long-term goal is to contribute to creating a circular bio-economy, and I believe synthetic biology is the key to a greener future.  
        Currently, I'm working on several projects, including:

        - **Sustainable Proteins**: Applying AI to develop alternative food proteins.
        - **Protein Design**: Using _in-silico_ directed evolution to improve protein functionality.
        - **Promoter Prediction**: Optimising neural network models for bacterial promoter prediction.
        - **WASP**: Developed a pipeline for protein functional annotation based on AlphaFold structural models.
        
        I'm passionate about advancing these fields and always open to discussing ideas and collaborating with new colleagues.
